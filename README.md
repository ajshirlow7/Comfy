- Promote Self-Care: Share practical tips and techniques for managing stress, anxiety, and other challenges in daily life.
- Foster Community: Create a supportive environment where users feel comfortable reaching out for help or learning how to support someone else.
- Ensure Accessibility: Design the site to be user-friendly and accessible on all devices, with clear navigation and readable content.

## Colors

The color palette for Comfy is intentionally simple and calming, using mostly dark greys, soft whites, and subtle accent colors. 

Dark Grey / Charcoal: Used for backgrounds (e.g., navbar, struggles section, reach out section). This is inspired by Bootstrap’s bg-dark (#212529).
White and Light Grey: Used for content sections and cards to provide contrast and keep text easy to read (e.g., #fff, #f8f9fa, #e9ecef, #dee2e6).
Accent Colors: Subtle accent colors are used for buttons and highlights, such as Bootstrap’s primary blue for buttons.

## Fonts

The Comfy website uses two Google Fonts: Pacifico and Roboto Slab. Pacifico is used for the logo and key highlights, giving the site a friendly and welcoming personality. Roboto Slab is used for headings and body text, providing excellent readability and a modern, approachable feel across devices.

## Imagery

Imagery on the Comfy website is used purposefully to support the content and enhance user engagement. 

 The main image on the site is sourced from (https://www.pexels.com/), ensuring high quality and appropriate licensing. 
 Simple, line-based icons are used throughout the site to aid navigation and highlight key features. All social media icons are sourced from (https://icons8.com/).
