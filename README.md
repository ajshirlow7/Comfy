## Introduction

Comfy is a supportive and informative website dedicated to mental health awareness and well-being. Our goal is to provide accessible information about common mental health struggles, practical techniques for self-care, and connections to trusted organisations that offer help. Whether you're seeking guidance for yourself or looking to support someone else, Comfy is here to remind you that you are not alone. Explore resources, learn about mental health, and reach out for support. All in one welcoming space.
